If a population is normal with mean μ and standard deviation σ, the sampling distribution of X is also normal with:
μ_x' = μ  and σ_x' = σ / sqrt(n)
As n increases, σ_x' decreases.

**Central limit theorem:**
Even if the population is not normal, sample means are approximately normal as long as the sample size is large enough.
As the sample size gets large enough, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes almost normal regardless of shape of population.
Central Tendency
μ_x' = μ
σ_x' = σ / sqrt(n)

For most distributions, n > 30 will give a sampling distribution that
is nearly normal.
For fairly symmetric distributions, n > 15.
For normal population distributions, the sampling distribution of the
mean is always normally distributed.

Z = (X' - μ_x') / σ_x' = (X' - μ) / (σ/sqrt(n))
