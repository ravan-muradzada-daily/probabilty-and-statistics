 **Simple event**
• An event described by a single characteristic
• e.g., A day in January from all days in 2019

**Joint event**
• An event described by two or more characteristics
• e.g. A day in January that is also a Wednesday from all days in 2019

**Complement of an event A (denoted A’)**
• All events that are not part of event A
• e.g., All days from 2019 that are not in January


|                   | January | Not January | *Total* |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- |
| **Wendesday**     | 5       | 47          | 52      |
| **Not Wendesday** | 27      | 286         | 313     |
| ***Total***       | 31      | 333         | 365     |

**Mutually Exclusive Events**

• Events that cannot occur simultaneously

*Example: Randomly choosing a day from 2019:*
*A = day in January; B = day in February*

• Events A and B are mutually exclusive

----
**Collectively exhaustive events**

• One of the events must occur
• The set of events covers the entire sample space

*Example: Randomly choose a day from 2019:*
*A = Weekday; B = Weekend;*
*C = January; D = Spring;*

• Events A, B, C and D are collectively exhaustive (but not mutually
exclusive – a weekday can be in January or in Spring)
• Events A and B are collectively exhaustive and also mutually exclusive.

Marginal probabilty is also simple probabilty (another name).

P(A) = P(A and B1) + P(A and B2) + ... + P(A and Bk)
Where B1, B2, ..., Bk are k mutually exclusive and collectively
exhaustive events.

---
General Addition Rule:
P (A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

If they are mutualy exclusive:
P (A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

---
**Conditional probability:**
We use whenever A has happened and want to define the probabilty of B.
If B happened: 
P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

If A happened:
P(B | A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

----
Two events are independent if and only if:
P(A | B) = P(A)

---
**Multiplication rule:**
P(A and B) = P(A | B) * P(B)

If A and B are independent, then P(A | B) = P(A), so
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

---
Marginal probability for event A:
P(A) = P(A | B1) * P(B1) + P(A | B2) * P(B2) + ... + P(A | Bk) * P(Bk)
