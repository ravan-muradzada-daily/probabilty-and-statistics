1) To import anything in R, we use this: `demoName <- read.csv('nameOfExcelFile.csv')`
2) To view the excel file, we use: `View(demoName)`
3) Main statistical indicators: mean, standard deviation (sd), standard variance (var), max, min, range, median, quantile or percentile.
4) In the functions, when we use `na.rm=FALSE` parameter (as the last one), that will ignore null elements.
5) If sd and var are high, that refers the data is widely spread.
6) If **mean** > **median**, that is right-skewed. When **mean** < **median**, that is left-skewed. When they are equal, that is symmetric (normal distribution).
7) In normal distribution (when Mean ≈ Median ≈ Mode), the shape of curve is **bell-shaped**, that is normal curve. When Mean > Median > Mode, **Tail extends to the right**. 
	When Mode > Median > Mean, **Tail extends to the left**.
8)  **Kurtosis and Shape Summary**:

| **Kurtosis** | **Shape Description**    | **Peak** | **Tails** | **Outliers**  |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------- | --------- | ------------- |
| **≈ 3**      | Normal-like distribution | Moderate | Moderate  | Moderate      |
| **> 3**      | Sharp peak, heavy tails  | Sharp    | Heavy     | Many outliers |
| **< 3**      | Flat peak, light tails   | Flat     | Light     | Few outliers  |
9) When skewness > 0, this is right-skewed; when skewness < 0, that is left-skewed and when skewness ≈ 0, that is symmetric (normal dist).
10) Use `describe` function to know main statistical indicators. This method comes from `psych` package.
11) Use `stat.desc` function to know main statistical indicators. This method comes from `pastecs` package. We can use `options(digits=2)` to decrease the count of numbers after the point.
12) If we find skewness and kurtosis, we should import this package `e1071`. Then we can just use `skewness(demo$value) and kurtosis(demo$value)` functions.
13) If we want to find quartiles according to given percentages, we should write smth like that: `quantile(icecream$icecream, probs = c(0.07, 0.38, 0.72))`. (If we are wanted to find 7%, 38% and 72% percentiles). The results are 3.6; 9.7; 23.1. We can write result part like that:

		#7 percent of the values are under 3.6
		#38 percent of the values are less 9.7
		#72 percent of the values are less 23.1
		

14) To find mode, we should import this package: `"modeest"`. We need to use this function from this package: `mfv(demo$value)`.
15) The `aggregate()` function in R is used to **group data by a factor (e.g., education level)** and apply a function (e.g., mean, median) to another column (e.g., age). As the first parameter, we should give we write the data which we will calculated for and the second parameter will a factor which we group using this: 
	`aggregate(directMail$age, by=list(directMail$educ), FUN=var)`
