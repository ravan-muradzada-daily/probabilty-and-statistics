Statistics is the study of data—how to collect, analyze, and interpret it. It has two main types: **descriptive** (collecting and summarizing data) and **inferential** (making conclusions from data).

**Key points:**

- Statistics involves presenting and summarizing data.
- It includes methods for analyzing and drawing conclusions.
- It deals with random variables from samples.
---
Inferential statistics help draw conclusions about a population based on a sample and measure the reliability of those conclusions. It includes **Hypothesis Testing** and **Regression Analysis**.

---
A **population** is the entire group of items or individuals being studied, while a **sample** is a smaller portion taken from the population for analysis.

---
**Categorical (qualitative) variables** classify data into groups (e.g., "yes/no," major, architectural style).

**Numerical (quantitative) variables** represent quantities:

- **Discrete** → From counting (e.g., number of students).
- **Continuous** → From measuring (e.g., height, weight).

---
**Numerical Descriptive Statistics:**

- **Central tendency** → How data values cluster around a central point.
- **Variation** → How spread out the values are.
- **Shape** → The overall pattern of data distribution.

---
**Mean Formula:**

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
$$
**Median:**
 In an ordered array, the median is the “middle” number (50% above, 50% below).

**The Mode:**
Value that occurs most often.

**Midrange:**
The number exactly midway between a lowest-valued data, L, and a highest-valued data,
H. It is found by averaging the low and the high values: midrange = (L+H) / 2.

----
There are 4 kinds of variation: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of variation.
range = x(largest) - x(smallest).

---
**Sample Variance Formula:**

$$
S^2 = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

Where:
- **s²** = sample variance
- **n** = number of sample data points
- **xᵢ** = each individual data point
- **x̄** = sample mean
- **∑** = summation across all data points
