### **If population variance is known**

![[12.png]]

**Here sigma is population deviation (not sampling deviation).**

How to find Z(alpha/2) in the first formula? First we need to need to know alpha, for that we just subtract confidence level from 1. If confidence level is 95%, we find alpha = 1 - 0.95 and that is 0.05.  
Then we just divide it to two, and the result is 0.025. Then we subtract this from 1, like 1 - 0.025. The result is 0.975. Then we just need to find this value inside the table (without splintering it).

For the second and third formulas, we need to find Z(alpha). While finding it, we just to similar thing to previous one, just we do not need to divide it to two.

### What if we are not given population variance (or deviation)
In this case we have two subcases: n>=30 or n < 30.

#### **If n>=30**
The first case is pretty easy.
To find e:

Interval:

Here, **s** is sample deviation.

#### **If n<30**
![[18.png]]
Here, **s** is sample deviation. t is another table like Z table. To find value from t table, we need to find alpha/2 first. Imagine, confidence level is 95%, alpha = 1-0.95=0.05. We divide it to two and it is 0.025. We define v variable where v = n-1. Then from the rows, we search v and from columns we search alpha/2.

### If we are given an error, how to find n? When we are given popularity deviation, too?
