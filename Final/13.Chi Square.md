Steps:

H0 must be independent and H1 dependent.

We need to find df = (r - 1) * (c - 1).

Then we create a new table which contains expected values.
X_ij = sum(X_row) * sum(X_col) / sum(all)

From the last formula we find test value of chi square.

Now we need to find critical value for chi square.
So, we have already df value and alpha (given, if no, take 0.05). Then we search chi square table. From upper, we search for alpha and from left, we look for df.

If Xtest > X_c, that means we reject H0.

# **Simpson paradox**
**Simpson’s Paradox** occurs when a trend or relationship that appears in **separate groups** of data **reverses or disappears** when the groups are **combined**. It shows how misleading it can be to interpret data without considering **underlying subgroups** or **confounding variables**.

> In simple words: **What looks true in parts can look false in the whole** — and vice versa.
