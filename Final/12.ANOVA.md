To find SSA, we just need to multiple the size of group and subtraction of this group's mean and overall mean.

To find SSW, we subtract the group's avarage from each group elements and sum their square.
So, for each group we need to find their mean and then we find subtraction of mean and each element, then find their squares sum. At last we sum all these sums.
