Imagine a problem like:
![[46.png]]
![[47.png]]
To find P, always we use: 
We find the absolute value of the value (like 2.05 or 1.84) in the Z table. We divide them to two parts and find intersection. The value from table it the bigger part of the graph. If we are searching for bigger part, that is ok. Otherwise, we just need to subtract it from 1.

In this kind of problems, because Ztest < 0, we use p_value = 2 * P(Z < Ztest). However, if it were positive, we would use p_value =  2 * P(Z > Ztest).

# Using critical value to test hypothesis
We have alpha, n, sigma (or s), X_.
We find Ztest (or t_test if it is s):

Now it is time to find Z_critical or t_critical. 
- For Z_critical using alpha (or alpha/2 if it is two tailed), we find the corresponding value inside the table and determine its row and column, then combine them. (like estimating interval). 
- For t_critical, we use v = n - 1 and alpha(or alpha/2 if it is two tailed) and find the result from its table. 
We create our according to our hypothesises. If Ztest is inside the selected area, the H0 is rejected, otherwise no.
